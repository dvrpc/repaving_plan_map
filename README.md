Map showing PennDOT District 6's 5-year repaving plan and paving packages

## About

This map shows PennDOT-owned roads on District 6's resurfacing plan
for the next few years. Segments identified in the most recent paving
package are highlighted. The plan is dynamic, changing based on road
conditions, budgets, and other maintenance priorities. This map is
updated as new plans are made available through PennDOT's website and
as new paving packages are released.
